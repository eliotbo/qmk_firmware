● How to Use This QMK Repository for Your Work Louder Work Board

  Based on your files, here's how to modify and flash your keyboard:

  1. Modifying Your Keymap

  Your main keymap is at /workspace/workspace/qmk_firmware/keyboards/work_lo
  uder/work_board/keymaps/eliot_midi/keymap.c

  To modify keys:
  - Edit the keymaps array in keymap.c to change key mappings
  - Your current layers are: _NOTES, _DRUMS, _SESSION, _ROUTER
  - Use QMK keycodes to define keys (e.g., KC_A, MI_C, MO(layer))

● 2. Compiling the Firmware

  Your keymap already has the compile instructions at lines 17-19:

  # Open QMK MSYS terminal
  cd qmk_firmware
  make work_louder/work_board:eliot_midi

  This creates a .hex or .bin file in the root directory.

● 3. Flashing to Your Keyboard

  Two methods:

  Method A - Direct Flash (if keyboard supports DFU):
  make work_louder/work_board:eliot_midi:flash
  Then put your keyboard in bootloader mode (usually hold RESET button or
  key combo).

  Method B - Using QMK Toolbox:
  1. Download QMK Toolbox
  2. Load the compiled .hex file
  3. Put keyboard in bootloader mode
  4. Click Flash

  Quick Workflow Summary:

  1. Edit /workspace/workspace/qmk_firmware/keyboards/work_louder/work_board
  /keymaps/eliot_midi/keymap.c
  2. Run make work_louder/work_board:eliot_midi
  3. Flash with make work_louder/work_board:eliot_midi:flash or QMK Toolbox

● Your simpler non-MIDI keymap is at
  /keyboards/work_louder/work_board/keymaps/eliot/ if you want to work with
  that instead.
